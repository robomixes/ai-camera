step1 : 
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/camera-ai.service

Step 2:

[Unit]
Description=Raspberry Pi Camera AI Analysis Service (Virtual Environment)
# Wait until the network is up before starting the service
After=network.target

[Service]
# Run the script as the 'admin' user (Crucial for file permissions and access)
User=admin 
# The directory where ai-general.py is located. 
# We assume this is where you want relative paths (e.g., config files) to resolve.
WorkingDirectory=/home/admin/cameraapp/ 

# The core command: Use the specific Python interpreter from the virtual environment
# ExecStart = [PYTHON_EXECUTABLE] [PYTHON_SCRIPT_PATH]
ExecStart=/home/admin/env/bin/python /home/admin/cameraapp/ai-general.py 

# The service should automatically restart if it crashes (e.g., due to a bug or memory issue)
Restart=always
# Wait 10 seconds before attempting a restart
RestartSec=10  

[Install]
# Enable the service for multi-user system boot
WantedBy=multi-user.target

*********************************************************************

step3: Enable and Start the Service

Once the file is saved, you need to tell systemd about the new service and then enable it to start automatically on future boots.
1. Reload the systemd Manager
Bash

sudo systemctl daemon-reload

2. Enable the Service (Auto-start on boot)
Bash

sudo systemctl enable camera-ai.service

3. Start the Service Immediately (Test run)
Bash

sudo systemctl start camera-ai.service

*********************************************************************

Setp4: Verification

Use the journalctl command to check the startup logs and ensure the script is executing correctly within the virtual environment and selecting the default menu option.
Check Service Status:
Bash

sudo systemctl status camera-ai.service

View Live Logs:
Bash

sudo journalctl -u camera-ai.service -f

*********************************************************************

step5: Delete the Service (Remove Permanently)

To completely remove the service, you must first disable it, then delete the service file, and finally, reload systemd.
Step	Command	Description
3a. Stop	sudo systemctl stop camera-ai.service	Ensure the service is not running.
3b. Disable	sudo systemctl disable camera-ai.service	Prevent auto-start on next boot.
3c. Delete File	sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/camera-ai.service	Permanently delete the configuration file.
3d. Reload	sudo systemctl daemon-reload	Tell systemd to drop the service configuration from its memory.
3e. Check	sudo systemctl reset-failed	(Optional) Clear the failed status from the system log.
