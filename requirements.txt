# --- Core System & Hardware ---
# Official library for Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2/3 and HQ Camera
picamera2

# --- Computer Vision & AI Backend ---
# OpenCV (cv2) for image processing, drawing, and video handling
opencv-python

# NumPy for efficient array and numerical computations (essential for CV/AI)
numpy

# TensorFlow Lite Runtime for executing the FaceNet TFLite model
# NOTE: The version must match your Python version and architecture (e.g., Python 3.9 on RPi)
# You may need to replace this with a specific wheel file if this generic name fails.
# The tflite-runtime wheel must be installed after all others.
tflite-runtime==2.14.0 # Or use the specific version compatible with your OS/Python

# --- AI Detection (Assuming YOLOv8 based on previous code snippets) ---
# Install the Ultralytics library for high-performance AI models
# If you are only running a TFLite model, you might not need this.
ultralytics

# --- Database / Helper Packages ---
# If you are using a standard Python database for logging (e.g., sqlite3, which is built-in)
# You don't need to list it here unless you are using a third-party DB like SQLAlchemy or peewee.

# Input handling for the timed menu (optional, often built-in on Linux, but safe to list)
# The 'select' module is a standard library, so no extra package is typically needed.
